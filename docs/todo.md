1. finish on screen display and make it work as it used to
2. move all not needed code and stick in doc directory
3. make comment heading for all functions to make clear
4. put all the entities next to each other and check they make sense, add
   comment heading
5. go through bit by bit and make docs for github readme

## think about

what happens step by step, so why do things go weird when going from levelone
back to start screen?

## refactor

rename Character to Entity in entities make as many properties protected... if
they don't like it, who needs access other than bass classes?
